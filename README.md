# zotero for medical students
distance learning workshop in the COVID-19 lock-down

## COVID-19 context and its effects on information management training programme 

Librarians from Health University Library of Rennes 1 used to train each year about 110 medical interns (6-8th year of University) to 
- perform more efficient research with Pubmed or other search engines including our library catalog, Google Scholar, EBM databases
- retrieve, organize and edit bibliographic information with Zotero (open source bibliographic management sotfware). 
This session uses to take 6 hours (3 hours for each subject).
During the coronavirus crisis, we had to transform all our scheduled workshops into e-learning training sessions. The lack of available trainers made compulsory to reduce the content of the initial session. 
We agreed with the Faculty staff in charge of this diploma to reduce the number of training hours to three and to focus on bibliographic management.
The original workshop on information research was partially replaced by some simple task to do at home previously to the session : 

- carefully selecting a paper about COVID-19 or SARS-COV2 on pubmed that seems to be enligthening or important to the student (enough to be worth sharing with others)
- selecting a paper on Medrxiv or Biorxiv on the same topic
- selectiong a paper on Pubpeer on the same topic that has received at least 5 comments.

Moreover students received [https://focus.univ-rennes1.fr/Zotero_DMG/installer|instructions] to download and set Zotero on their computer and were asked to do it before the session.

## Preamble : 

as an introduction, we wanted to show how scientific communication is accelerated during crisis such as COVID-19 which increases the risks of publishing sloppy or dubious papers available to the public. We also presented the growth of prepublications and post-reviewing comments as an opportunity for Science (quicker access to results and wider access to scholarship conversation)
