# zotero for medical students
distance learning workshop in the COVID-19 lock-down

## COVID-19 context and its effects on information management training programme 

Librarians from Health University Library of Rennes 1 used to train each year about 110 medical interns (6-8th year of University) to 
- perform more efficient research with Pubmed or other search engines including our library catalog, Google Scholar, EBM databases
- retrieve, organize and edit bibliographic information with Zotero (open source bibliographic management sotfware). 
This session uses to take 6 hours (3 hours for each subject).
During the coronavirus crisis, we had to transform all our scheduled workshops into e-learning training sessions. The lack of available trainers made compulsory to reduce the content of the initial session. 
We agreed with the Faculty staff in charge of this diploma to reduce the number of training hours to three and to focus on bibliographic management.
The original workshop on information research was partially replaced by some [simple tasks](https://focus.univ-rennes1.fr/Zotero_DMG/avant_la_seance) to do at home previously to the session : 

- carefully selecting a paper about COVID-19 or SARS-COV2 on pubmed that seems to be enligthening or important to the student (enough to be worth sharing with others)
- selecting a paper on Medrxiv or Biorxiv on the same topic
- selectiong a paper on Pubpeer on the same topic that has received at least 5 comments.

Moreover students received [instructions](https://focus.univ-rennes1.fr/Zotero_DMG/installer) to download and set Zotero on their computer and were asked to do it before the session.

## Preamble : 

as an introduction, we wanted to show how scientific communication is accelerated during crisis such as COVID-19 which increases the risks of publishing sloppy or dubious papers available to the public. We also presented the growth of prepublications and post-reviewing comments as an opportunity for Science (quicker access to results and wider access to scholarship conversation)

- **slide 1**: The figure shows the traditionnal publishing cycle compared to the one including the deposit of a preprint, an option accepted by a growing number of publishers. One can check each journal's policy about preprints on [SherpaRomeo website](http://sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php). Depositing a preprint guarantees the authorship of a discovery and gives a quicker access to the results. 
- **slide 2**:The homepage of Biorxiv repository shows a warning about papers that it gives access to. The status of these "publications" should not be mixed with the status of duly peer-reviewed articles. A confusion sometimes happened among the public but also among journalists who are not specialized in sciences but had to cover COVID-19 crisis.
- **slide 3**: shows the progressive definition of SARS-COV2 RÂ° (Disease basic reproductive number) from preprints to peer-reviewed articles. Fortunately a lot of COVID-19 studies available on a preprint server could be reviewed and published afterwards, sometimes with only minimal corrections. The figure is extracted from an [article](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30113-3/fulltext) published in Global Health
-**slide 4** On the other side, preprints servers may host hastily edited or questionable articles such this one which was used by Luc Montagnier to forge a new conspiracy theory (more about this on [wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9sinformation_sur_la_pand%C3%A9mie_de_Covid-19#Fabrication_sur_la_base_du_virus_du_Sida). Papers are very seldom retracted on preprint servers. The negative impact of this sloppy study led the site managers to put a retractation warning on the article page.
-**slide 5** One comment found on Pubpeer about one study of hydroxychloroquine was reproduced here. The comment raises the issue of a peer-review process which was conducted with too much haste. Another issue points out a conflict of interest between the authors and the editors. This slide gives opportunity to the trainers to explain some basic rules of scientific integrity.
